IVOA JAXB annotated Objects
============================

The aim of this project is to gather together object representations of the 
[IVOA schema](http://www.ivoa.net/xml/) with a particular emphasis on the Registry

At the moment the objects are autogenerated from the schema using the xjc tool with 
numerous plugins to create JAXB annotated classes.

Likely futures for this library
* autogenerate then hand annotate to make the objects more comfortable to work with.
* JPA annotation to allow objects to be serialized to databases too.

The API that these objects represent should be regarded as unstable at the moment, 
though the main structure of the object trees will remain fairly constant at the 
source schema are constant - the library will reach the 1.0 stage when autogeneration 
is superseded by hand editing of the (once) autogenerated files.

RegTAP

There is additionally an model for RegTAP instances
