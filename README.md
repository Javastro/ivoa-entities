IVOA JAXB Annotated Objects
============================

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.javastro.ivoa/ivoa-entities?Label=ivoa-entities)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.javastro.ivoa/ivoa-entities/)

The aim of this project is to gather together object representations of the 
[IVOA schema](http://www.ivoa.net/xml/) with a particular emphasis on the Registry

At the moment the objects are autogenerated from the schema using the xjc tool with 
numerous plugins to create JAXB annotated classes.

The API that these objects represent should be regarded as unstable at the moment, 
though the main structure of the object trees will remain fairly constant at the 
source schema are constant.



Security
--------

This code in this library is configured to use only local schema definitions as
per the recommendations of https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md


RegTAP
------

this library used to contain an implementation of RegTAP - this has now been removed as it is superseded now by the VO-DML based implementation at https://github.com/ivoa/RegTAPDM
